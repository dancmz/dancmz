### 🤓 Medical Industry Fun Facts

Did you know?

- A typical medical device has over **10,000 tiny parts**, basically a mini high-tech puzzle ([FDA](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices)).

- Some devices are so sensitive they can detect changes smaller than the width of a **human hair**, talk about precision ([NIH](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters)).

- Hospitals today use thousands of IoT devices daily to monitor patients. It’s like a “smart city” inside the hospital ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/07/22/how-iot-is-transforming-health-care/?sh=4a19c7db5b2f)).

- Thanks to data analytics, manufacturers can catch tiny defects before they become big problems, saving lives and lots of money ([McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/the-case-for-digital-transformation-in-health-care)).

- Even small improvements in the production process can speed up making life-saving devices by **days or weeks** ([Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/life-sciences-and-health-care/articles/digital-transformation-medical-device-industry.html)).
